## 🌠 Introduction

Hello ! I welcome you to my portfolio 🪐

Since a young age, my curiosity has driven me to understand my environment and how things work. This led me to pursue scientific studies and, a year ago, to a career change into web development. Passionate about coding and website creation, I have already gained initial professional experience and continue today to develop various projects to deepen my knowledge of web technologies.

To discover all my projects, I invite you to check out my portfolio and my github 😊
